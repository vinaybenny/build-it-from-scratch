# build-it-from-scratch

Primary objective: Build various statistical, computing and machine learning concepts/algorithms from ground-up to better understand/illustrate how these things work, and why.

- Linear Least Squares Estimator: implemented using only the matrix primitives in Tensorflow. 
  - Contains both homoskedastic and robust std. error estimations (using Huber-White errors) for coefficients.
  - Has hypothesis testing for regression coefficients (2 sided t-test).
  
- Neural Network : implemented using numpy and scipy matrix libraries only.
  - Notebook containing the complete step-by-step implementation of a 3-layer neural network as a blogpost.
  - Implementations of sigmoid, forward and backpropagation and batch gradient descent.
